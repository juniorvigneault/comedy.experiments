# Comedy Experiments
A collection of short experiments focusing on how interaction design affordances and online GUI interfaces can be re-oriented for comedy.


### June 6 2022 - Initial thoughts and ideas
#### Notes on interaction design

I started by researching affordances and refreshing my memory on terms related to interaction design. Here are some notes I took:
1. Intuitive everyday design is design that needs no explanation; affordances make design intuitive.
2. It's not sufficient for design to be rational and logical. Affordances direct the perception of possibilities for action and provide strong clues to the operation of things. *Clickable*, buttons, tabs, *draggable*, sliders, *spinnable*...
An affordance is an **action possibility in the relation between a user and an object.**

**Affordances**: defines and determines what actions are possible for an agent.<br>
**Signifiers**: specifies how people discover those possibilities and communicates where the action should take place. Signs and signals that help people act in a way they can operate the physical or digital product.<br>
**Perceived affordances**: Some signifiers are simply the perceived affordance; the signifier is part of the structure of the physical or digital product. Example: a doorknob.  

#### Early brainstorm
What do I find funny in interaction design (based on past past experience):
1. Repetition and build-up, like clicking on something several times and it becomes more and more intense.
2. Obnoxious stuff that is flashing in your face, shaking or buzzing. Being forced to look at something, something that is hard to make disappear or keeps reappearing.
3. Humanizing buttons, objects, widgets. Give inanimate things a personality or human characteristics. Example: a very stressed-out datepicker or a super sexy input box. Or an extremely sad draggable. A family of cute little dialog boxes that are lost and need help.
4. Contrasts between something serious/corporate/conventional in a ridiculous environment.
5. Adding real-world physics on a web-page. Relates to humanizing the elements by making them act as if they were *living on earth*.
6. Forcing the user to do stuff. Example: clicking on something they don't want to in order to complete a task, something ridiculous, shameful or humiliating. The user still does it because they want to move on.
7. Frustrating UI? Example: clicking on something by accident, like refreshing the page after inputing important stuff. Or opening another page by accidentally clicking on something. Wonder if that could be funny or just really frustrating. I guess it's funnier for the designer than for the user. It *could* become funnier to integrate some kind of laughing like a sitcom every time the user encounters a frustrating thing. For example every time the user tries to click on a button it moves slightly from under the cursor and every time there is a laughing crowd sound.
